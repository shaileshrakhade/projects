    <h3>E-Authentication.</h3>
      <h3>Here user login his self not only user id & Password Also using QR code.</h3>
    <p>QR Code Authentication utilizes a QR code on a printed badge that acts as a contactless card. ... <br />
        This form of authentication is ideal for younger users, such as K-5 students
        who struggle with traditional username/password authentication or for enterprise use cases to streamline<br /> 
        authentication and enhance user convenience.</p>
    <p>
        A QR code (abbreviated from Quick Response code) is a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) first designed in 1994<br />
        for the automotive industry in Japan. A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which 
        it is attached. In practice, QR codes often contain data for a locator, identifier, or tracker that points to a website or application. <br />
        A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) 
        to store data efficiently; extensions may also be used.[1]

    <h4>ABSTRACT </h4>
    <p> Authenticating the students’ identity and authenticity of their work is increasingly important to reduce academic malpractices and for quality assurance purposes in Education. There is a growing body of research about technological innovations to combat cheating and plagiarism. However, the literature is very limited on the impact of e-authentication systems across distinctive end-users because it is not a widespread practice at the moment. A considerable gap is to understand whether the use of e-authentication systems would increase trust on e-assessment, and to extend, whether students’ acceptance would vary across gender, age and previous experiences. This study aims to shed light on this area by examining the attitudes and experiences of 328 students who used an authentication system known as adaptive trust-based e-assessment system for learning (TeSLA). Evidence from mixedmethod analysis suggests a broadly positive acceptance of these e-authentication technologies by distance education students. However, significant differences in the students’ responses indicated, for instance, that men were less concerned about providing personal data than women; middle-aged participants were more aware of the nuances of cheating and plagiarism; while younger students were more likely to reject e-authentication, considerably due to data privacy and security and students with disabilities due to concerns about their special needs. </p>

      <h4>OVERVIEW </h4>
    <p>Authentication is a process to access to login account and accessing the service provided by the system or server using the password. It also has an alternative way to authenticate the user which is using biometric authentication by using fingerprint or iris recognition. However, human has the tendency to create easily remember password which it will lead to a problem. By definition, authentication is the use of one or more mechanisms to confirm that you are the authenticated user. Once the identity of the human or machine is validated, access is granted. There are existing acknowledged three authentication factors are things the user knows, things the user have and biometric authentication. Biometric-based 
        authentication is a good way to authenticate the user but it is expensive and raises some privacy concern. One Time Passwords (OTP) offers a promising alternative for two-factor authentication systems. A one-time password is a password that is valid for only one login session or transaction, on a computer system or other digital device (Cheng, X. R. et al. ,2005). Two-factor authentication solution equips customers with a cost-effective means of providing flexible and strong authentication to very large scale. The goal of computer security to maintain the integrity, availability and privacy of the information entrusted to the system can be obtained by adopting this authentication technique.

    <h4>PURPOSE </h4>
    <p>Electronic authentication is the process of establishing confidence in user identities electronically presented to an information system.[1] Digital authentication, or eauthentication, may be used synonymously when referring to the authentication process that confirms or certifies a person's identity and works. When used in conjunction with an electronic signature, it can provide evidence of whether data received has been tampered with after being signed by its original sender. Electronic authentication can reduce the risk of fraud and identity theft by verifying that a person is who they say they are when performing transactions online. </p>
